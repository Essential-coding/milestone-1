## Wireframes

For the wireframes i used a tool called [marvelapp](https://marvelapp.com/). It is simple and understanding and it gave the feeling of simplicity when it came 
to drawing the wireframes , because it made the drawing and the overall look of using the tool easy without any complications. It was pretty easy to find what i was looking for since they had lots of of different alternatives.

View my wireframes for different screen sizes to be more specific:

- Desktop Wireframes 

- Tablet Wireframes

- Mobile Wireframes

For further investigation you can click on [wireframes](https://github.com/Essential-coding/milestone-1/tree/master/wireframes). It will show you all the wireframes that i created
for the three devices, mobile, tablet and desktop!
